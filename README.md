# Seed Phrase Generator & Checker

A Seed Phrase Generator is a tool designed to create a unique set of words that can be used to 
seed a cryptocurrency wallet, enabling users to securely store and access their digital assets. 
These seed phrases are typically made up of a sequence of 12 randomly generated words that act 
as a backup for the wallet.

# Usage
To start the brute force process, run the SeedGen.exe
After running, press the '2' key to start searching for wallets.
The program will constantly generate seed phrases and check the balances of linked wallets. Information about each verified wallet will be recorded in the console.
If a wallet with a non-zero balance is found, its information will also be added to found_wallets.txt in the project directory.
